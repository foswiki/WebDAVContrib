%TOC%

[[http://webdav.org][WebDAV]] stands for "Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning".
It is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol which allows users to collaboratively
edit and manage files on remote web servers.

This module contains a full Class 2 <nop>WebDAV implementation. It uses a standard abstraction
of the server filesystem, allowing it to be used with a range of different filesystems,
including (via the [[FilesysVirtualPlugin]]) the Foswiki datastore.

The module is designed to work with a number of different web servers, and also includes
a complete stand-alone server implementation.

Integration with <nop>WebDAV means that users can edit topics and attachments using an
appropriate <nop>WebDAV enabled client program, such as Microsoft Office, <nop>LibreOffice,
Open Office, etc. When used with the companion [[https://foswiki.org/Extensions/WebDAVLinkPlugin][WebDAVLinkPlugin]]
or [[https://foswiki.org/Extensions/NatSkin][NatSkin]], you can embed links to <nop>WebDAV
resources in Foswiki pages that will open the linked documents in native applications.

Foswiki permissions are honoured throughout.

Use of the [[FilesysVirtualPlugin]] means that all the data views supported by that
module are available to <nop>WebDAV clients, so clients can read and write Foswiki topics
as text, as HTML, as a JSON data structure, or as any other view supported by <nop>FilesysVirtualPlugin.

---++ Installation Instructions

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

   * [[ConfiguringWebDAVContribWithApache][Configuring WebDAVContrib With Apache mod_perl]]
   * [[ConfiguringWebDAVContribWithFCGI][Configuring WebDAVContrib With FastCGI]]
   * [[ConfiguringWebDAVContribWithHTTPDaemon][Configuring WebDAVContrib With HTTP::Daemon]]

---++ Debugging

If you encounter problems with clients it can be useful to be able to trace the activity
of the server. All the web servers have some mechanism to pass a debugging option
in. This tracing option is in the form of a bit mask, where the bits mean:

   * 1 to enable error tracing (shows reason for failures)
   * 2 to enable tracing of <nop>WebDAV requests.
   * 4 to enable detailed debugging
   * 8 to enable memory usage information
   * 16 to enable very detailed filesystem level tracing

The bits can be combined e.g. =17= will enable detailed filesystem tracing and error
reporting. Trace information is output to theweb server error log.

If you have experience, then another tool that can be very useful in debugging is
a network protocol analyser, such as [[http://www.wireshark.org][wireshark]].

---++ Configuring <nop>FilesysVirtualPlugin

Refer to the documentation for [[FilesysVirtualPlugin]] for information on configuring
it to support different data views. Each data view presents topics as a different
file type, allowing you to read and write the same topic in a range of different
formats.

---++ Clients

There are many DAV clients out there that it would be impossible to describe them
all.

---+++ Linking to DAV resources from a web browser

To link to a DAV resource from a web browser, all you have to do is link to
the DAV url of the resource. However most browsers will open the link
in a "read only" mode. If you want to open DAV resources from Firefox
or Chrome for editing using a DAV-aware native application
(such as Microsoft Word, <nop>LibreOffice or Open Office) you can use the companion
[[https://foswiki.org/Extensions/WebDAVLinkPlugin][WebDAVLinkPlugin]]. Note that this plugin is not required when using [[https://foswiki.org/Extensions/NatSkin][NatSkin]] and
[[https://foswiki.org/Extensions/TopicInteractionPlugin][TopicInteractionPlugin]].

---+++ Accessing <nop>WebDAV resources on Microsoft Windows

For more information on how to access <nop>WebDAV resources under MS Windows see [[WebDAVAndWindowsClient]].

---+++ <nop>LibreOffice

The otherwise excellent <nop>LibreOffice suite has implemented locking since version
4.1. Unfortunately their lock implementation is not consistent with the <nop>WebDAV spec, and
we have had to disable lock support for <nop>LibreOffice. The only risk this poses is if
two people try to edit the same attachment via <nop>WebDAV simultaneously.

---++ Server Validation

All the standard [[http://www.webdav.org/neon/litmus/][Litmus tests]] for
a class 2 <nop>WebDAV server pass. WebDAVContribLitmusTests describes how to
run them.
