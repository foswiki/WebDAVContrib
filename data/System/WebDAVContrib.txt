[[http://webdav.org][WebDAV]] stands for "Web-based Distributed Authoring and
Versioning". It is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol which allows users
to collaboratively edit and manage files on remote web servers. 

This module contains a full Class 2 !WebDAV implementation. It uses a
standard abstraction of the server filesystem,
allowing it to be used with a range of different filesystems,
including (via the FilesysVirtualPlugin) the Foswiki datastore.

The module is designed to work with a number of different web
servers, and also includes a complete stand-alone server implementation.

Integration with <nop>Web<nop>DAV means that users can edit topics and
attachments using an appropriate <nop>Web<nop>DAV enabled client program,
such as Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer, Open Office, etc. When used
with the companion WebDAVLinkPlugin, you can embed links to !WebDAV
resources in Foswiki pages that will open the linked documents in
native applications.

!Foswiki permissions are honoured throughout.

Use of the FilesysVirtualPlugin means that all the data views supported by
that module are available to !WebDAV clients, so clients can read and write
Foswiki topics as text, as HTML, as a JSON data structure, or as any other
view supported by FilesysVirtualPlugin.

---++ Debugging

If you encounter problems with clients it can be useful to be able to trace the
activity of the server. All the web servers have some mechanism to pass a
debugging option in. This tracing option is in the form of a bit mask, where the
bits mean:
   * 1 to enable error tracing (shows reason for failures)
   * 2 to enable tracing of !WebDAV requests.
   * 4 to enable detailed debugging
   * 8 to enable memory usage information
   * 16 to enable very detailed filesystem level tracing
The bits can be combined e.g.
=17= will enable detailed filesystem tracing and error reporting. Trace
information is output to the web server error log.

If you have experience, then another tool that can be very useful in
debugging is a network protocol analyser, such as
[[http://www.wireshark.org][wireshark]].

---+++ Configuring !FilesysVirtualPlugin
Refer to the documentation for FilesysVirtualPlugin for information on
configuring it to support different data views. Each data view presents
topics as a different file type, allowing you to read and write the same
topic in a range of different formats.

---++ Clients
There are many DAV clients out there that it would be impossible to describe
them all.

---+++ Linking to DAV resources from a web browser
To link to a DAV resource from a web browser, all you have to do is link to
the DAV url of the resource. However most browsers will open the link
in a "read only" mode. If you want to open DAV resources from Firefox
or Internet Explorer for editing using a DAV-aware native application
(such as Microsoft Word or Open Office) you can use the companion
WebDAVLinkPlugin.

---+++ Accessing <nop>WebDAV resources on Microsoft Windows

There are so many problems with the Microsoft implementation of !WebDAV
that unfortunately it merits a topic of it's own: WebDAVAndWindowsClient

---+++ Libreoffice

The otherwise excellent !LibreOffice suite has implemented locking since version
4.1. Unfortunately their lock implementation is not consistent with the !WebDAV spec, and
we have had to disable lock support for !LibreOffice. The only risk this poses is if
two people try to edit the same attachment via !WebDAV simultaneously.

---+++ Server Validation

All the standard [[http://www.webdav.org/neon/litmus/][Litmus tests]] for
a class 2 !WebDAV server pass. WebDAVContribLitmusTests describes how to
run them.
