---+ Configuring !WebDAVContrib with HTTP::Daemon

Using HTTP::Daemon is the simplest way to get a lightweight !WebDAV server
up and running quickly. It lacks most of the features of more sophisticated
web servers, such as SSL support and complex authentication schemes, which
restricts it to use behind firewalls.

The server is implemented in a script in =tools/http_daemon.pl=

<verbatim>
Usage: http_daemon.pl [options]

Options:
   -fs FS or --filesystem FS
      set filesystem to Filesys::Virtual::FS (e.g. PlainPlusAttrs)
      default is Foswiki
   -r R or --root R
      set root filesystem path to R (required, for PlainPlusAttrs only)
   -t N or --trace N
      set tracing to N
   -ar R or --authrealm R
      set authrealm to R (default is Foswiki)
</verbatim>
The script is run by cd'ing to the tools directory and:
<verbatim>
$ perl http_daemon.pl http://server:80/root
</verbatim>

The parameter specifies the url we are serving, so this server will respond
to URLs starting with =http://server/root/=, where =/root= is a URL path that will
be used to access Foswiki data. For example, to access the text of this topic
you would use =http://server/root/%WEB%/%TOPIC%.txt=.

If you use a different filesystem - for example, the =PlainPlusAttrs= filesystem
which can be used to export simple directory structures - then you may need
to use the =--root= option to tell the script where the root of the
filesystem is. For example,
<verbatim>
$ perl http_daemon.pl http://server:8080/ --filesystem PlainPlusAttrs --root /home/user/webdav
</verbatim>
will export the files in =/home/user/webdav= under the URL
=http://server:8080/=

Error messages are output to standard error (the console).
If you are having problems with !WebDAV you can enable tracing using the
=--trace= option. See WebDAVContrib#Debugging for more information.

Note that the only authentication scheme supported by this server is Basic Auth,
which means passwords are sent in plain text. The filesystem is expected
to provide authentication support. Note that =PlainPlusAttrs= does not
support any form of authentication.
